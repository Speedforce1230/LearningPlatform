# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## How to run the project

1. Install git (if you're unsure if you have it or not, you can run `git` in any terminal to check).

2. Install node.js (if you're unsure if you have it or not, you can run `npm` in any terminal to check).

3. Create a new folder and run

   ```bash
   git clone <URL OF THIS REPO, COPY FROM THE ADDRESS BAR>
   # You might have to provide your github password if you're doing it for the first time.
   ```

5. In your folder, you should now have a folder called 'LearningPlatform', run these commands

   ```bash
   cd LearningPlatform
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

7. In your terminal, the project should now run at localhost, you can open it in your browser.

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
